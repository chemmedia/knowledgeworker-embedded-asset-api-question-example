# Knowledgeworker Create Embedded Asset API Question Example

An example implementation of [knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api](https://github.com/chemmedia/knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api).

This example code aims to ease the development of rich embedded assets for responsive [Knowledgeworker Create](https://www.knowledgeworker.com/?utm_source=code&utm_campaign=embedded-asset-api-example) contents using the [knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api](https://github.com/chemmedia/knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api) and [knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api-ui](https://github.com/chemmedia/knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api-ui) javascript library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the example project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to build a distribution folder.
Build your own Knowledgeworker Create Embedded Asset by forking this repository.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to get started. Please have a look at the documentation on how to install them on your operating system.
- node v.18+ https://nodejs.org/
- pnpm https://pnpm.io/

### Installing

Download and install dependencies by typing:

```
pnpm i
```

### Development

This example is based on [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). We created a pnpm script so you can start a development server easily by typing:

```
pnpm dev
```

After you see the `VITE ready` you can open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Create your own asset by modifying `index.html` and `src/app/index.ts` and its imports.


## Deployment

Build a distribution folder by typing the following command.

```
pnpm build
```

Now you can upload the zip archive from `dist` folder as media asset to Knowledgeworker Create.
